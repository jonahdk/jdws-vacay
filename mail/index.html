    <p>Hello! Welcome to the brand new division of Jonah's Dog Walking Service, called Vacay Mail! What this service provides is when you are on vacation, every day at a time you choose, I will go to your house, pick up your mail, and put it in a certain box. Beforehand, you will tell me the day you come home, and a time window to expect you. When you come home, you will text me telling me that you are home and I will go to your house and give you your mail you received while on vacation. </p><br>
    <p>NOTICE: THIS DIVISION IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS.</p><br>
    <p>The phone number you text when you are home is separate from the regular phone number associated with JDWS. The number you will text is: (202) 713-9839. Thank you. (The number is from Washington, DC. I am aware of this, and yes, it is my number.) </p>
